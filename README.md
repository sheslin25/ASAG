# Automatic Short Answer Grading
In our Research we provide a new pipeline for the task of Automatic Short Answer
Grading. We employ a combination of
deep learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to automatically grade
free text responses. The main contribution
of this paper is a semi-supervised pipeline
consisting of clustering similar responses
and sampling training data for our models
from these clusters. We find that the inclusion of this clustering approach not only
improves performance but also reduces
the number of training responses needed
to achieve reasonable performance.

This repo contains our codebase aswell as our data
